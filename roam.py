"""roam.py â”€ Randomly drive the robot and capture data.

This script issues random movement commands, calls collect_data.main(),
and saves the command list to *commands.txt*.

If the user presses **Ctrl-C** we catch SIGINT in `signal_handler()` and
perform file-system hygiene:
    Remove orphaned images in ./data (e.g. *before_123.jpg* without
     matching *after_123.jpg*, or vice-versa).
    Remove any temporary *.tmp* files left by a partially executed
     run.
Then the program exits gracefully with status 0.
